Anti-bullying policy

Policy version control 



Contents


Introduction 
Bullying or harassment of any kind is unacceptable, whether it is on or off the academy site or in the online or offline world.  
It will never be seen as ‘just banter’.
 If bullying or harassment does occur, all children should be able to inform a trusted adult in the academy and know with confidence, that incidents will be treated seriously, promptly and effectively. 
It is an expectation of anyone who knows that bullying is taking place to ensure that it is reported and acted upon using the appropriate academy processes and procedures.
Everyone must understand what bullying is and the impact it has on those who have been bullied and those who have bullied. 
Everyone must know that there will be ongoing care and support for both victim and alleged perpetrator. 
All adults have a duty to support children to practice and build the skills that create better relationships.
We also recognise that children develop and mature at different stages and ages; some require additional support, guidance and reasonable adjustments to be made in line with the Equalities Act.
 Behaviour principles 
(see also Behaviour Policy)
Underpinning this policy are the beliefs that everyone has the right to: 
Recognition of their unique identity 
Be treated with respect and dignity 
Learn and work in a safe environment 
Be protected from harm, violence, assault and acts of verbal abuse
Outstanding behaviour is achieved through a culture and ethos of high expectations, excellent modelling of behaviour and effective systems that incentivise good conduct and deter poor behaviour. 
Most social, emotional and behavioural skills are learned and need to be modelled, explicitly taught, practiced and embedded. Rather than focusing on unwanted behaviours, the behaviour for learning approach puts value on positive behaviours and restorative approaches to conflict.
Through our restorative approaches practice, we will develop children’s ability to empathise, reflect and take responsibility for their own actions.
We will develop children who are confident, self-assured learners with excellent attitudes to learning.
We expect all to show their respect for each other and behave in a way that supports each other’s learning.
For staff to build effective relationships with children they need to be supported to develop knowledge skills and understanding. Their own emotional health and well-being is vital to positive relationships and will be supported by the academy.
We see outstanding behaviour as children behaving well, because they know how to, and because they want to, not because an adult tells them to.
In our academy, everyone will endeavour to understand that communication is at the heart of every behaviour.
We recognise that behaviours can be an indication of additional learning, social or emotional needs or as a result of attachment, trauma or adverse childhood experiences. They may also be an indication that a child is being bullied themselves or are victims of abuse. Some children require additional support in their journey to achieving outstanding behaviours. The academy will ensure early identification of behavioural difficulties, and that children are well supported to achieve improvements over time.

Definitions
Bullying
There is no legal definition of bullying. 
Bullying is an ongoing and deliberate misuse of power through repeated verbal, physical and/or social behaviour that intends to cause physical, social and/or psychological harm 
It can involve an individual or a group and be aimed towards one or more persons who feel unable to stop it from happening. 
Bullying can happen in person or online, via various digital platforms and devices and it can be obvious (overt) or hidden (covert). 
Bullying of any form or for any reason can have immediate, medium and long-term effects on those involved, including bystanders. 
 What bullying is not: 
Single episodes of social rejection or dislike 
Single episode acts of nastiness or spite
Random acts of aggression or intimidation 
Mutual arguments, disagreements or fights 
These actions can cause great distress. However, they do not fit the definition of bullying and they’re not examples of bullying unless someone is deliberately and repeatedly doing them
We recognise that bullying can be in several forms: 
Child to child
Adult to child 
Child to adult
Sexual harassment
This is defined as, ‘unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that can occur online and offline and both inside and outside of school/college’
Sexual harassment is a form of child-on child abuse/ bullying. 
All incidents of sexual harassment, abuse or violence are taken very seriously by the academy and details of how the academy will respond are outlined in the Child Protection and Safeguarding Policy

EXEMPLAR ONLY – edit/delete as required
Allegations of bullying: 
If an allegation of bullying occurs, the academy will:
Take it seriously 
Investigate as quickly as possible to establish the facts
 Record and report the incident; depending on how serious the case is, it may be reported to the principal 
Provide support and reassurance to the victim 
Make it clear to the ‘bully’ that this behaviour will not be tolerated. If there is a group of people involved, they will be spoken to individually and as a whole group. It is important that children who have harmed another, either physically or emotionally, redress their actions, and staff will make sure that they understand what they have done and the impact of their actions 
Discuss the matter with both parties, using restorative techniques
Ensure that if a sanction is used, it will correlate to the seriousness of the incident and the ‘bully’ will be told why it is being used
Inform parents
Children who have been bullied will be supported by: 
Offering an immediate opportunity to discuss the experience with an appropriate member of staff of their choice.
Reassuring the child
Offering continuous support with a designated member of staff.
Restoring self-esteem and self-confidence. 
Referral to a peer mentor if appropriate.
Referral to a counsellor
Referral to outside agencies where appropriate
Offering continuous support and advice to parents/carers
Being informed about the outcome of the investigation into their concerns. 
Including children’s services where appropriate (e.g. where there are linked child protection concerns)
Children who have bullied will be helped by: 
Discussing what happened. 
Discovering why the child became involved including establishing if they are a victim of bullying themselves
Establishing the wrong-doing and the need for change. 
Informing parents to help change the attitude of the child
Involving other agencies, including police and children’s services, to support a change in behaviour. Where appropriate
Referral to a counsellor where appropriate 
Attend a restorative meeting with the victim (both must agree freely to this)
When investigating a bullying incident, the following procedures are adopted:
The victim, alleged bully and witnesses will be interviewed separately
Members of staff will ensure that there is no possibility of contact between the children interviewed, including electronic communication
If a child is injured, they will be given medical attention immediately
Interviews will be conducted in a room which allows for privacy 
Staff will take a statement from each child involved 
All concerned children will be informed that they must not discuss the incident with other children
staff members involved in dealing with the incident are required to consider whether there is a need for safeguarding processes to be implemented. 
Bullying which occurs outside school premises 
Academy staff members have the power to discipline children for misbehaving outside the academy premises. Sections 90 and 91 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 say that an academy’s disciplinary powers can be used to address conduct when they are not on academy premises and are not under the lawful control or charge of a member of academy staff, but only if it would be reasonable for the academy to regulate children’s behaviour in those circumstances. 
 This may include bullying incidents occurring anywhere off the academy premises, such as on academy or public transport, outside the local shops, or in a town or village centre. Where bullying outside the academy is reported to academy staff, it will be investigated and acted on. 
The principal will also consider whether it is appropriate to notify the police or anti-social behaviour coordinator in their local authority of the action taken against a child.
If the misbehaviour could be criminal or poses a serious threat to a member of the public, the police will always be informed. 
While academy staff members have the power to discipline children for bullying that occurs outside the academy they can only impose the disciplinary sanction and implement that sanction on the academy premises or when the child is under the lawful control of academy staff, for instance on a trip.
Online/cyber bullying
 Online bullying is increasingly prevalent and will be treated as seriously as real-world bullying.
The academy will promote an understanding about online bullying through the academy’s online safety curriculum, assemblies [focus days, PSHE and RSE.- academy to customise]
Children will be taught how to recognise online bullying and how to take action. 
Victims of online bullying will be helped with securing crucial evidence from social media etc., by taking screenshots and not deleting messages.
Recognising the signs that someone is being bullied 
(see appendix 3 for details)
Sanctions 
For children who have demonstrated bullying behaviour, the academy’s behaviour for learning policy will be followed. 
In addition, using restorative practices in line with the ethos and culture of the academy, a plan will be implemented to identify the steps that need to be taken to change the behaviour in the future and support the student in being able to do this.
[Academy may wish to put details in here – they must be congruent with the behaviour for learning policy]
Recording
The academy will ensure that detailed bullying logs are kept and analysed to look for trends and patterns so that actions can be taken to reduce bullying in the academy.
All incidents will be recorded [academy to outline process for recording and reporting on data to SLT and governors]
Curriculum
Through the curriculum and other means, such as assemblies and anti-bullying week, the academy will ensure children know and understand what bullying is, including online/cyberbullying, and how to report it. It will teach children how to stay safe both offline and online and about the antisocial nature and effects of bullying. It will teach about the role of the bystander in bullying (see appendix 4).
 It will also teach, age and stage appropriately, skills including self- regulation, assertiveness, communication, negotiation, restorative practice, anger management, conflict management, empathy and resilience.
Equal Opportunities
Staff will ensure that no child involved in any incident of bullying is disadvantaged on the grounds of gender, race, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation, age, religion, or belief.
Vulnerable children 
SEND and EAL
At [Academy Name] we continually monitor our SEND children through the [Job role] regular one-two-one review meetings, daily through Personal Tutors and Heads of Year as needed: [academy to customise]

Type of bullying




Appendix 2 
Types of online bullying

Exclusion 
Exclusion is the act of intentionally leaving a person out from an online group such as chats and social media sites. The group then subsequently leave malicious comments and harass the one they singled out. 
Flaming 
Flaming is similar to harassment, but it refers to an online fight exchanged via emails, instant messaging or chat rooms. It is a type of public bullying that often directs harsh languages, or images to a specific person. Incidents of flaming that occur during the evening, weekends and holidays will not be dealt with by the academy. 
Outing 
Outing is when a bully shares personal and private information, pictures, or videos about someone publicly. A person is “outed” when his information has been disseminated throughout the internet. 
Masquerading 
Masquerading is a situation where a bully creates a fake identity to harass someone anonymously. In addition to creating a fake identity, the bully can impersonate someone else to send malicious messages to the victim. 
Harassment 
Harassment involves the bully sending offensive and malicious messages to an individual or a group and is often repeated multiple times. Cyberstalking is one form of harassment that involves continual threatening and rude messages and can lead to physical harassment.

Appendix 4
Bystanders and upstanders

Bystanders 
Someone who witnesses bullying, either in person or online, is a bystander. Friends, other children,  school staff, parents, coaches, and other adults can be bystanders. 
Children who are bullied often feel even more alone because there are witnesses who do nothing. When no one intervenes, the child being targeted may feel that bystanders do not care, or they agree with what is happening. 
There are many reasons why a bystander may not act, even if they believe that bullying is wrong. They may be afraid of retaliation or of becoming the target of bullying themselves. They might fear that getting involved could have negative social consequences. 
Upstanders 
An upstander is someone who sees what happens and intervenes, interrupts, or speaks up to stop the bullying. 
There are many things that bystanders to bullying can do to become upstanders: 
Question the bullying behaviour e.g., changing the subject or questioning the behaviour can shift the focus. 
Inform an adult – trusted adult school staff, family members.
Reach out privately to check in with the person who was bullied to let them know you do not agree with it and that you care. It makes a difference
